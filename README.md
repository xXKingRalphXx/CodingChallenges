These are just my answers to the python challenges on [this](codingbat.com/python) site.

The Xcode project titled "PennyPyramid" is just a project I made to compute the answer to [this](http://threeacts.mrmeyer.com/pyramidofpennies/) question.

Whatever you do with the code in this project does not concern me.
